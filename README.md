# hw_day-planner

1. I hardcoded the table for my schedule first with basic divs using colums and rows.
2. I changed the background color to light pink because I like it better.
3. I used save icons from fontawesome, using the clue from the starter code.
4. I added padding and margins to my time column and save buttons to center time and save icons.
5. I used Moment.js to keep track of the date.
6. I was able to get my text fields editable with "contenteditable="true""
7. Unfortunately I spent so much time trying to get my text inputs to change color in my script that I think I just confused myself more and I couldn't get them to work.
8. Javascript is absolutely melting my brain this week.
9. I plan on reviewing everything this weekend and resubmitting this once I understand the material enough to complete. 
10. Thank you for your time. <3
